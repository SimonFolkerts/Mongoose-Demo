Simple demo of using mongoose with express to communicate with a database

run `npm install` to get node_modules folder so that the project can run

don't forget to add a .env file that contains the `PORT` and your `DB_STRING` from MongoDB
e.g.
PORT=3000
DB_STRING=asdfasdfasdf

then run `npx nodemon index.js` to start the server.
